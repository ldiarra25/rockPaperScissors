Objective: This program will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

Algorithm
-create a code that checks who won each round
-create code that takes the input(choice) from the user
-we will create code that takes input from the computer
-check if the user wants to quit or if the user doesn't enter one of the options.
-loop each round of the game
-add statements at the end and beginning that welcomes and thanks the user for playing.
-loop the game so the user can continue to play until they decide to quit.

Pseudocode:

#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:

    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 of 3 press'q' to quit)
   
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    #(rock is r, paper is p, scissors is s)
   
    #import the random function
   
    #set computer score to 0
    #set player score to 0
   
    #while player score is less than 2 and computer score is less than 2: -- game will continue
   
        #computer choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used)
        #player choice = input(ask player to select rock, paper, or scissors)
       
        #start checking user options
        #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if player inputs'q': -- player wants to end game
        #   set keepPlaying to False -- ends loop
        #   stop the loop -- break statement
       
        #else if (player inputs roock and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors):
        #   print out DRAW
        #   print out player's score and computer score
       
        #else if (player inputs rock and computer scissors) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer inputs rock):
        #   add 1 to player score
        #   print out palyer and computer score
       
        #else if(player inputs rock and computer paper) or
        #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses rock) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer scissors):
        #   add one tp computer score
        # print out player and computer score
       
        #else:
        #   tell user their input is not valid
       
    #print statement thanking the players for playing
    #if player score is 2:
    #    print statemrnt letting player know they win
    #if computer score is 2:
    #   print statement letting player know they lost
    #print out player score and computer score
